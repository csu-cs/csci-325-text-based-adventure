Please decide how to communicate (team members can edit this file.)

Some Suggestions:

Twitter: Setup a twitter account that any team member can post to.  This allows everyone to communicate at their leisure and provide a full history of what has been said.

IM/Hangouts/IRC: Share everyone's hangout/IM/IRC account so people can communicate in real time.

email: share everyone's email account to send message back and forth.

You may setup physical meetings, but keep in mind that the online user(s) will need to have a virtual presence!

Team choice (edit below this line):

This is Stephen Gallo. We need to get going on this. My email is greenmonster8914@gmail.com, my bucmail is SAGALLO@csustudent.net and my cell is 8436973939. Also, I just set up a twitter account for this. The account name is javatextbasedadv (username javatextbaseadv) and the password is java325.

Hi this is Michael Belding. Email is michael_belding@yahoo.com and my cell is 8034207096. Lets figure out everybody part.

This is Lindsey Hatcher. My cell number is 8432712253 and my email is coke987123@gmail.com.

The twitter account is up and running. I just made a test tweet. I agree with Michael. We do need to figure out who will be doing which part. We also need to decide what the adventure will be about (what the player's character will be and what that character will be doing.

Hi everyone, this is Donnie Russell, my cell number is 864 417 8464, and my email is donovanerussell@outlook.com.

I am going to currently work on the requirements document and push it to github. If anyone has any ideas of what they would want to add to it, please let me know.

I already posted this on Twitter, but I'm working on a basic scenario for the game. (Basically a word doc with an idea we can use) I will upload once I'm done and we can discuss whether or not to use it or something else.

Heya, this is Richard Nathan Jackson. Can just call me Nathan. My email is thylus@live.com and my phone number is 8437080695. Texting would be the fastest way to get ahold of me! I may be an online student but I prefer group meetings IRL whenever possible! Anytime after 9:00 AM -12:00PM, then after 1:20PM - 6:00PM on MTThF. Free all day on Sat after 9:00!

Most of my basic scenario is done. Besides, I thought it would be easier to program the game with a story for it done. That way, most of the output statements can be copied and pasted directly from the story (should we decide to use it).
